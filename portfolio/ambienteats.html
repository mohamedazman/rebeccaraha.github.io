            <p>In order explore the desired interactions and how they could map to design possibilities, a group of team members recorded eating a meal together to better understand patterns and motions when eating. This exploration enabled the team to better understand how each interaction should be outputted through visual and auditory cues. Additionally, this enabled the team to discuss how often certain cues should play and how to keep users engaged without overwhelming them with the interaction.</p>

               <h5>Plate Sub-System</h5>
                <p>For the prototyping segment of the project, my main responsibility was the developing the user interactions and physical feedback from the plate.</p>
                <p>The plate was designed with two technical components - a neo-pixel ring and an LED strip.  These components were designed to interact with the other dynamic pieces dinnerware items (the fork and the cup) and developed to provide feedback when they were utlized.</p>

                 <p>Once an initial model for the system was created utilizing the rainforest theme, the team decided to develop additional environments with the same iteraction.</p>
                   <p>The second environment chosen to be designed was a space themed environments, which mapped to the following auditory and visual cues:</p>
                   <ul>
                   <li>Fork - Varying Space Weapon Noises</li>
