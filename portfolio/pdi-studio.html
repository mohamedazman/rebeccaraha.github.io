      <h3>PDI Studio Revitalized</h3>

                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <p>The Design, Innovation, & Society Studio (commonly called the Product Design & Innovation Studio) has been through a state of flux throughout the last two years. With increased dedicated space and new materials being allocated to the Design, Innovation, & Society (DIS) Program, the culture of the program has shifted. The PDI Studio: Revitalized project took a critical look at the past and current culture in order to create impactful change guided by Organizational Culture and Workspace Culture methodology.</p> </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the past four years, the Design, Innovation, and Society program has grown and adapted more deeply and vastly than ever before. The program has seen the emergence of a new Dean, the leave of a supplementary advisor, the loss of a key professor, the addition of new space, and the adoption of new tools and materials – and that is just scratching the surface. These growth and adaptations have altered the physical Design, Innovation, and Society Space, and in turn altered the respective community and culture of those who inhabit the space.</p>
                    <p>While many and most of these strides have been positive, some of the cultural changes incurred have not been to the program’s benefit. Increased space has moved students and all prototyping supplies out of the original Studio Space and into a new Auxiliary space. This migration of students and materials has led the Studio to lose the life it once had and become less of a living breathing space. The lack of prototyping supplies leave the Studio as a stark lifeless room, and the migration of students has led to less-cross year communication.</p>

            <h5>Constraints</h5>
            <p>A number of constraints bind Rensselaer, the DIS program, and the respective projects that can be done to improve the DIS program and PDI space. Past obvious constraints – ensuring all changes and improvements are legal, etc. – there are a number of additional constraints imposed on potential improvements. </p>
            <ul>
                          <li>Walls cannot be moved, painted, or physically/structurally altered. </li>
            <li>Dedicated space cannot be undedicated.</li>
            <li>Improvements cannot be costly – short term or long term.</li>
            <li>Manpower within the DIS program is limited. </li>
            <li>The design of these changes must compliment the space.</li> 
            <li>Changes must be easily moveable.</li>
            <li>Improvements must be sustainable (and therefore, reusable).</li>
            <li>Collaborative tools must be plentiful enough that multiple student groups can capitalize on them without infringing upon one another’s ability to collaborate.</li>
            <li>Collaborative tools must be easily accessible and storable.</li>

                    <h5>Shein’s Model of Organizational Culture &amp; Elsbach and Bechky’s Categories of Workspace Improvement</h5></div>
                    <p>The Schein Model of Organizational Culture dissects and inspects what makes, augments, and grows organizational culture from a number of angles. Schein’s extensive research takes these corporate characteristics and potential change catalysts into three master groups:</p>
                <ul>Physical and Social Context: Artifacts or Explicit Communication</ul>
                <ul>Espouse Values or Official Values</ul>
                        <ul>Basic Assumptions: How Individuals Perceive the Organization or Core Principles Underlying World Views<sup>1</sup></ul>
                        <p>The most sensible subset of Schein’s Model to explore in order to enact meaningful organizational change is the Physical and Social Context level. By effecting things can that be physically touched, seen, and interacted with, the best chance to affect a cultural change is achieved. When looking at tangible options to improve the Studio Space and in turn, the PDI culture, the best model to turn to is Kimberly Elsbach and Beth Bechky’s categories of workspace improvement. Elsbach and Bechky break down these improvements into three main types; Instrumental Symbolic, and Aesthetic,2 which can best be translated to; Functional, Creative or Collaborative, and Inspiring. These areas were my inspiration moving forward.</p>
                    <p>As Functional and Collaborative improvements were underway under the guidance of Dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, I chose to work within the Inspirational  Improvement area. This provided me with the unique opportunity to create the first piece of art that would live in the studio space.</p></div>
