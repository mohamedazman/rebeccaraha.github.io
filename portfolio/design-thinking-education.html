                <p>The Design Thinking for Kids project was conceptualized based on small principle: <span class="bodyunder">"Why weren't we exposed to Design Thinking and alternative frameworks for thought as children? Why is this only something you learn in <span class="special">very select</span> undergraduate settings?"</span> This question fueled our abmition and direction for the project.</p>

                 <p>Our team worked through <a href="http://designforamerica.com/process-guide/" target="_blank">Design for America</a>'s Design Thinking Process: Identify, Immerse, Reframe, Ideate, Build, and Test over the span of four months.</p>
                 <p>As we wanted to map our journey, for simplicity's sake, and in order to tailor the process to our time contraints and plans, we defined our project by four categories: Research, Synthesize, Strategize, and Test.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">                     <p>While our work is presented here in a very clearly and concisely, this is not how the design process always goes, or how our design process progressed throughout the three month duration of our project. As we were in the beginning stages of the project, research was constantly conducted to ensure we were moving in the proper direction. Furthermore, we chose to test early and test often - as we found this feedback integral to our design and understanding. Therefore these, and other, steps were not conducted in a linear progression, but as needed and found to be illuminating to the project.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, while I am no longer in Providence and cannot participate in the project, it has been picked up by the Design for America (DFA) Chapter at Brown University for multiple semesters. Our research, testing, and contacts have created a foundation for this group and DFA intends on running the project for the foreseeable future.</p>
