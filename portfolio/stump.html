				<h4>Scope</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<p>Develop a product or system which integrates the 'Connected Gifts' technology developed by Dr. Jon Cagan and Dr. Daragh Bryne.</p>

				<h4>Understanding the Technology</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<p>The 'Connected Gifts' technology enables two seperated persons to give their loved ones a gift at any moment to brighten their loved one's day. The technology integrates a locked gift box with an app that a loved one can utlize to unlock the box with at any time.</p>
                <p>The technology was developed in order to provide seperated couples to give each other personal artifacts at any specific point in time they see fit - whether spontaneously or pre-planned.</p>

				<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<p>Equipped with the IP, a number of areas for product development were brainstormed. Toys were chosen as the area with the most potentional for commercialization and therefore pursued.</p>
				<p>Through initial brainstorming, many concepts were explored. The first concept that came to mind was a Pokemon toy, where the pokeball included the 'Connected Gift's technology.</p>

				<h4>Connected Gifts + Pokemon</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>The Connected Gifts + Pokemon idea was explored as it seemed like the perfect marriage. The idea was explored and a model was developed where users could buy a Pokeball case which would come with pre-loaded tokens inside. Users could then play a videogame and unlock the physical tokens that would unleash content once again within the physical game. This feedback loop was seen promising in the 'phygital' (physical + digital) toy space but wasn't seen as particularly compelling.</p>
                <p>The team as a whole felt uninspired by the idea, and therefore went back to the drawing board.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<p>Once a first iteration design was completed, user interviews were conducted to understand if, and how, people would integrated Ellie the Elephant into their lives. In total, nine interviews were conducted with users and one interview was conducted with a former-Senior Vice President at a top Toy Company. These interviews provided the following insights:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>Parents prefer for toys at higher pricepoints be able to be used with multiple children.</li>
					<li>A toy like this has to be a "gotta-have-it".</li>
                    <li>There has to be a build-up to final gift reveal to increase excitement and suspense.</li>
