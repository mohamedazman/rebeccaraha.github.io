				<h4>Scope</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<p>Develop a product or system which integrates the 'Connected Gifts' technology developed by Dr. Jon Cagan and Dr. Daragh Bryne.</p>

				<h4>Understanding the Technology</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<p>The 'Connected Gifts' technology enables two seperated persons to give their loved ones a gift at any moment to brighten their loved one's day. The technology integrates a locked gift box with an app that a loved one can utlize to unlock the box with at any time.</p>
                <p>The technology was developed in order to provide seperated couples to give each other personal artifacts at any specific point in time they see fit - whether spontaneously or pre-planned.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
            <div class="borderline"></div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<p>Equipped with the IP, a number of areas for product development were brainstormed. Toys were chosen as the area with the most potentional for commercialization and therefore pursued.</p>
				<p>Through initial brainstorming, many concepts were explored. The first concept that came to mind was a Pokemon toy, where the pokeball included the 'Connected Gift's technology.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
               <div class="borderline"></div>
            <div class="row">

				<h4>Connected Gifts + Pokemon</h4>
			</div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <img src="../images/stump/poke.png" class="port-pic">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>The Connected Gifts + Pokemon idea was explored as it seemed like the perfect marriage. The idea was explored and a model was developed where users could buy a Pokeball case which would come with pre-loaded tokens inside. Users could then play a videogame and unlock the physical tokens that would unleash content once again within the physical game. This feedback loop was seen promising in the 'phygital' (physical + digital) toy space but wasn't seen as particularly compelling.</p>
                <p>The token being used in the digital environment didn't seem to add a value in the layer of interaction it provided for the user that justified the cost and therefore the team felt that there was a better opportunity that could be tapped into.</p>

				<h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<p>From here, a comparative analysis was conducted to better understand items on the market and how the 'Connected Gifts' may integrate into each.</p>
                <p>In order to truly understand their capabilities and how the technology may apply, Hasbro's animinatronic unicorn, Star Lily, was acquired and user tested.</p>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><img class="port-pic" src="../images/stump/slily.png"></div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6"><img class="port-pic" src="../images/stump/dash-robot.png"></div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6"><img class="port-pic" src="../images/stump/toymail.png"></div>
			</div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>Animatronic toys were seen to be a large opportunity area. For this reasons, Star Lily was used as a working example of an animantronic toy which could be integrated with the 'Connected Gift's technology.</p>
                <p>Star Lily was found to have two major modes of play, physical and digital, both which interact with each other.</p>
                <p>These features, seen below, were explored to understand where players of game play could be added through 'phygital' play. The ability to use tokens in the physical environment to interact with Star Lily was seen as a more positive facet to an integrated system than in the Pokemon concept - where the token would have interacted in the digital environment.</p>
                
                <h5>Physical Features</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Four Major Motions (Wings, Paw, Head/Neck, Eyes)</li>
                    <li>Sugarberry for Feeding</li>
                    <li>Horn Interaction</li>
                    <li>Typical Plush Play (Petting, Grooming, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Music and Audio Feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Digital Features</h5>
                <h6>Three Play Modes</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sugarberry Orchard</li>
                    <li>Crystal Cavern</li>
                    <li>Rainbow Falls</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Continuous Game Features</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wishing Well</li>
                    <li>Treasure Chest</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite this breadth of physical and digital features, integration through an animatronic toy, such as Star Lily, was still not the correct fit.</p>

				<h4>User Research</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<p>Once again, the team went back to the drawing board to brainstorm. After many rounds of brainstorming, the concept of reward systems came into play. The technology seemed like a great opportunity to merge rewards with gamifacation.</p>
                <p>In order to better understand this opportunity, five parents with children ages two to eleven were interviewed. These interviews revolved around their reward and gifting habits and how they interact with their children when separated - as opposed to any specific toy or opportunity.</p>
                <p>From these interviews, the teams were better able to understand how parents interacted with their children and what opportunities would definitely not be a good fit.</p>			</div>
		</div>
            
            <div class="borderline"></div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
				<h4>Iteration One Design</h4>
			</div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Equipped with these insights, the team once again began to brainstorm concepts. By incorporating these insights, the team was able to develop a new concept, Ellie the Elephant.</p>
            <p>Ellie the Elephant was designed to be a plush toy with a plastic, digitally connected, treasure chest attached her back. Parents could load Ellie's chest with a small note, a small gift, some candy, or anything they'd like to gift as a reward or while away and unlock it at any time they saw fit - enabling the child to access the gift.</p>
            <p>This toy provided parents with the opportunity to interact with their children on a deeper level when physically seperate and add suspense to the gifting process. Additionally, it was closer to the original vision of the use of the technology - which was very important for both inventors.</p>
                <p>The team took this early stage concept for review and to test with users in order to understand where its true opportunities were and where there were gaps in the experience.</p>
                <p>For educational purposes, this was the concept presented at the Midterm Critique.</p>

				<h4>User Research Interviews</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
				<p>Once a first iteration design was completed, user interviews were conducted to understand if, and how, people would integrated Ellie the Elephant into their lives. In total, nine interviews were conducted with users and one interview was conducted with a former-Senior Vice President at a top Toy Company. These interviews provided the following insights:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>Parents prefer for toys at higher pricepoints be able to be used with multiple children.</li>
					<li>A toy like this has to be a "gotta-have-it".</li>
                    <li>There has to be a build-up to final gift reveal to increase excitement and suspense.</li>
