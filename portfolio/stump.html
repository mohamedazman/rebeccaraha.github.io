        <h9><span class="bold">Connected Gifts Technology</span> - Carnegie Mellon University | Fall 2016</h9>
        <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>Develop a product or system which integrates the 'Connected Gifts' technology developed by Dr. Jon Cagan and Dr. Daragh Bryne.</p>

      <h4>Understanding the Technology</h4>
      <p>The 'Connected Gifts' technology enables two seperated persons to give their loved ones a gift at any moment to brighten their loved one's day. The technology integrates a locked gift box with an app. </p>

      <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
      <p>Equipped with the IP a number of areas for product development were brainstormed. Toys were chosen as the area with the most potentional for commercializing and therefore pursued.</p>
        
    <p>Through initial brainstorming, many ideas were explored. The first idea that came to mind was a Pokemon toy, where the pokeball included the 'Connected Gift's technology.</p>

      <p>Once a first iteration design was completed, user interviews were conducted to understand if, and how, people would integrated Ellie the Elephant into their lives. In total, 9 interviews were conducted with users and 1 interview was conducted with a former-Senior Vice President at a top Toy Company. These interviews provided the following insights:</p>
