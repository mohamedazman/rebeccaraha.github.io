            <h9><span class="bold">Studio V, Ethnographic Design</span> - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute | Fall 2014</h9>
 
        <h5>Scope</h5>
        <p>Develop a product or system solution to fill the educational gaps in Ark Community Charter School's 6<sup>th</sup> Grade Students' curiculum and learned knowledge.</p>
        <h5>User Research</h5>
        <p>User research was conducted in through three main methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interviews with faculty, staff, and students at Ark Community Charter School</li>
            <li>In-class observation of class periods</li>
            <li>Activities with students</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h6>Co-Design Actvity</h6>
           <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><img src="../images/nutrition-kitchen/troycodesign.jpg" class="port-pic"></div>
        <p>It was very important to us to develop meals that were familiar Ark Community Charter's 6<sup>th</sup> grade students in order to provide them with a platform which resonated with their daily lives. By enabling students to contextual the information gained from Nutrition Kitchen into real knowledge, students were able to apply the knowledge learned in their own decision making.</p>
        <p>A Co-Design Activity was used to uncover this data. Students were given ingredients and asked to make different meals. Students were able to use a card as many times as desired and even make their own when they felt an important ingredient was missing. These meals, along with other healthy counterparts, were import to add to Nutrition Kitchen's library of recipes to teach students about their current meal choices and healthy alternatives.</p>
        <h5>User Testing</h5>
        <p>Software was tested with students early and often. First with paper prototypes, then a rudimentary mockup made with Sketch, and finally a second iteration mockup developed with Flash.</p>
        <h5>Recommendations</h5>
