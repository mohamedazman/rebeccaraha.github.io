                <p>Improve Millennials' current experiences with their kitchens.</p>

                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><h4>Understanding the Opportunity Space</h4>
                    <p>In order to properly understand the problem space, initial research was conducted and findings were assessed. From there, the team chose to use the SET (Social, Economic, and Technology) Factors method of organizing everyone's findings. By categorizing research findings in three categories, the team was able to find trends and areas of opportunity.</p></div>

                         <h4>Product Opportunity Gaps</h4>
                    <p>After initial anlaysis of findings, the team brainstormed Product Opportunity Gaps (POGs) in order to understand potentional focus areas. Once group members generated ideas, they were presented and affinity maps. After the first round, another two rounds of brainstorming was conducted - this time in pairs. POGs were once again presented.</p></div>

                    <p>After three rounds of brainstorming, POGs were voted on once to eliminate undesirable POGs - leaving 16 POGs. Group members were then given seven votes each to disperse as they see fit on the remaining POGs. From here, 6 POGs remained.</p>
                    <p>A weighted matrix was utilized from here and after discussions based on the weighted matrix's results, three possible POGs were chosen:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Global Cuising Sharing</li>
                    <li>Kitchen Waste Use and Management</li>
                    <li>Space Management/Climate Control in Small Kitchens</li></ul>
                   <p>Finally, from these three 'Kitchen Waste Use and Management' was chosen.</p></div>
