            <p>Bazi was created with the goal of taking long-distance competitive play out of the purely digital realm and moving it into the physical realm in mind.</p>
            <p>This product was developed with the objecctive of learning how to code a product from scratch - for that reason a lot of user research and user experiece considerations were monetarily put on hold to enable growth in terms of technical competency.</p>

                <h5>Wiring Schematic</h5>
                <p>A schematic of the circuit created with these components is below. This circuit was soldered to a quarter-sized perma protoboard for the final prototype.</p>
                <p>This circuit was powered by a regardable 3.7v Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with a 2500mAh capacity. This LiPo was plugged into a 1000 Rechargable Powerboost which the powered the circuit using a micro-USB cord.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
            <p>The physical form of Bazi was fabricated from 1/8" milky white acrylic. The shape, a cuboctahedron, was cut from the acrylic using a .dxf file developed in Adobe Illustrator. This lasercut form was hot-glued.</p>
                <p>In addition to the form, button holders were cut in order to ensure the buttons would stay in place when despite the amount of pressure a user would use to press each button. These button holders were thin long rectangles which were cut out of clear acrylic to ensure that the light from the the neopixels were still coming through the device clearly and evenly.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>For demostration purposes, a follower and leader device were coded in order to simply the the code.</p>
                <p>Device 1, the leader, was also coded to use a push-button start as opposed to a hall-effects interrupt as a start in order to test a different iteraction with the device.</p>
                <p>Device 2, the follower, uses a hall-effects interrupt as planned as a start to verify that interaction as the desired the one.</p>

                <p>Moving forward a lot of modifications would need to be made and features would need to be added to move Bazi from a concept prototype to a market ready device.</p>
                <p>Some of the higher-level necesssary next steps have been outlined below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add on/off or reset/play again switch.</li>
                    <li>Created a more controlled gameplay where color patterns can only increment by one in length each round.</li>
                    <li>Change form of send button or send action to decrease user confusion and therefore user error.</li>
                    <li>Change battery to a wireless charging battery/base.</li>
